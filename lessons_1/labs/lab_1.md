## Instructions

1. Create a new React application using `npx create-react-app react-page-layout` (or use Vite: `npm create vite@latest react-page-layout -- --template react`).
2. Build a page that looks like the mockup below.
3. You should create the following components: `App`, `Homepage`, `Header`, `SearchBar`, `EmployeeList`, and `EmployeeListItem`.
4. Style your components to accurately match the given layout. You do not need to include images, but can if you have time.
5. No functionality is needed — just arrange the layout with React components.
6. Push your completed code to a GitHub repository.
